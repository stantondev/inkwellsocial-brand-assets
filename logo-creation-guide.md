## 1. Concept

### The Big Idea

The Inkwell logo is a **fountain pen writing "Inkwell" in cursive calligraphy**. The pen nib appears to be mid-stroke, physically writing the word. The act of writing is the logo.

This concept works on multiple levels:
- It communicates what Inkwell is: a place for writing
- The fountain pen signals craft, intentionality, and quality
- The cursive makes it feel personal and handwritten — not corporate
- The pen nib alone works as a standalone icon (favicon, app icon)

### What You're Making

| Piece | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pen nib mark** | A stylized fountain pen nib, facing 45° (as if writing) |
| **"Inkwell" wordmark** | Cursive calligraphy lettering |
| **Full logo** | Nib + wordmark in horizontal lockup, nib appearing to write the "I" |
| **Icon** | Nib alone, centered in a square — for favicon, app icon, avatar |

### Reference Mood

Think of these as visual anchors for the feel you're going for:
- The Montblanc logo (elegant simplicity, the nib/snowflake is distinctive)
- Moleskine's wordmark (literary, refined, lowercase serif)
- Lamy's identity (precise, contemporary but warm)
- Parker Pen's heritage (timeless, classical marks)

---

## 2. Choose Your Script Style

**This is the one creative decision you need to make before starting.** The three options below each create a different character for the brand. Review them and pick one.

---

### Option A: Copperplate / Spencerian

**What it looks like**: 19th-century formal penmanship. Dramatic contrast between thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes. Elegant loops and flourishes. Prestigious and timeless.

**Character**: Formal, prestigious, classic. Signals "serious writing" and "quality craft." Might feel more premium or old-world.

**Font references to view before deciding**:
- [Pinyon Script — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pinyon+Script) — Spencerian style, highly refined
- [Ruthie — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ruthie) — flowing copperplate
- [Lovers Quarrel — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lovers+Quarrel) — more ornate

**When this is right**: If you want Inkwell to feel like a heritage brand, a fine writing instrument company, slightly formal and prestigious.

---

### Option B: Modern Calligraphy ← **Recommended**

**What it looks like**: Contemporary brush-influenced lettering. Still has thick/thin contrast (thicker downstrokes) but less formal than copperplate. Flows naturally. Clearly handwritten but polished.

**Character**: Warm, approachable, crafted. Signals "thoughtful writing" without feeling stiff. Most readable at small sizes. Pairs best with Inkwell's indie-but-quality personality.

**Font references to view before deciding**:
- [Great Vibes — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes) — **recommended starting point for Inkwell**
- [Sacramento — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sacramento) — slightly looser, very elegant
- [Alex Brush — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alex+Brush) — clean and refined
- [Pacifico — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico) — more casual/rounded

**When this is right**: If you want Inkwell to feel personal, crafted, and contemporary — like a beautiful modern journal.

---

### Option C: Casual Handwritten

**What it looks like**: Genuinely handwritten feel. More variation in letterforms. Slightly imperfect. Feels like real handwriting from someone with good penmanship.

**Character**: Personal, organic, honest. Less polished but more authentic. Might feel more like a personal journal than a brand.

**Font references to view before deciding**:
- [Caveat — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat) — natural handwriting, good readability
- [Kalam — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam) — Indian pen style, beautiful
- [Patrick Hand — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand) — clean casual
- [Satisfy — Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Satisfy) — between casual and script

**When this is right**: If you want the brand to feel approachable, unpretentious, like a note from a friend.

---

### How to Preview These

1. Go to [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com)
2. Search for each font name above
3. In the "Type tester" section, clear the sample text and type **"Inkwell"**
4. Increase the size to 60–80pt
5. Compare them side by side — **you're looking for: Is this how "Inkwell" wants to sign its name?**

**Recommendation**: Start with **Great Vibes** (Option B). If it feels too formal, try **Caveat** (Option C). If you want more prestige, try **Pinyon Script** (Option A).

## 3. Fountain Pen Nib Specifications

The nib mark is the standalone icon and the visual anchor of the full logo.

### Shape Description

A fountain pen nib is a teardrop/diamond-like shape that comes to a point at the bottom, with a distinctive center slit running from the tip partway up the body.

```
     ___________
    /           \          ← Nib shoulders (wider at top)
   /             \
  /               \
 /                 \
|         |         |      ← Center slit (this is the key detail)
 \        |        /
  \       |       /
   \      |      /
    \     |     /
     \    |    /
      \   |   /
       \  |  /
        \ | /
         \|/               ← Tip / tipping point
          ·                ← Optional: small ink dot at very tip
```

### Specifications

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Orientation** | 45° angle, pointing down-right (as if in mid-stroke writing) |
| **Aspect ratio** | Approximately 1:1.4 (width:height) |
| **Center slit** | Runs from the tip ~60% of the way up the nib body |
| **Stroke weight** | 1.5–2px for the slit; solid fill for the nib body |
| **Fill color** | Ink Midnight `#1a2744` (solid, no gradients) |
| **Slit color** | White (creates the void through the dark nib) |
| **Optional ink dot** | Small circle at the tip, slightly larger than the slit width |
| **Minimum size** | Should read clearly at 24×24px |

### Reference Images

Search for these to study real nib anatomy before drawing:
- "Montblanc pen nib vector" — see how simplified logo versions work
- "fountain pen nib svg icon" on thenounproject.com or flaticon.com (for reference only — don't use)
- "Lamy nib illustration" — clean, minimal versions
- Wikipedia "Nib (pen)" article — clear technical diagram

### What to Avoid

- Do not use a quill feather — that is not the Inkwell mark
- Do not use a pencil — we are specifically a fountain pen brand
- Do not add extra decorative elements (scrollwork, flourishes on the nib body)
- Keep it simple — this needs to work at 16px as a favicon

---

## 4. Required File Outputs

When you're done, you should have these files ready to add to this repo and to `apps/web/public/`:

| Filename | Format | Dimensions | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inkwell-logo-full.svg` | SVG | Scalable | Primary — all web use |
| `inkwell-logo-full@2x.png` | PNG | 1200×400px | Email headers, social media |
| `inkwell-logo-white.svg` | SVG | Scalable | Dark backgrounds |
| `inkwell-logo-black.svg` | SVG | Scalable | Print, single-color use |
| `inkwell-icon.svg` | SVG | Scalable | Favicon, app mark |
| `inkwell-icon-512.png` | PNG | 512×512px | PWA icon |
| `inkwell-icon-180.png` | PNG | 180×180px | Apple Touch Icon |
| `inkwell-icon-192.png` | PNG | 192×192px | Android/PWA icon |
| `inkwell-icon-64.png` | PNG | 64×64px | Browser favicon |
| `inkwell-icon-32.png` | PNG | 32×32px | Browser favicon (small) |
| `favicon.ico` | ICO | 16/32px multi | Browser tab icon |

**Padding/safe zone for icons**: When creating icon PNGs, the nib mark should occupy ~75% of the space with ~12.5% padding on all sides.

---

## 5. Tool Paths

Choose the tool you're most comfortable with. **Path A (Figma) is strongly recommended** — it's free, vector-native, and exports SVGs correctly.

---

### Path A: Figma (Recommended — Free)

Figma is free at [figma.com](https://figma.com). No installation needed — runs in the browser.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your File

1. Create a new file → New design file
2. Create a frame: `W: 600`, `H: 200` (for the full logo)
3. Create a second frame: `W: 200`, `H: 200` (for the icon)
4. Set fill to `#fafaf9` (cream background — helps you see what it will look like)

#### Step 2: Create the Pen Nib

**Option A (easiest): Find a pre-made SVG and modify it**
1. Go to [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) → Search "fountain pen nib"
2. Download a free SVG (requires free account)
3. Import it into Figma: drag-drop the SVG file onto your canvas
4. Double-click the shape to enter vector edit mode
5. Adjust the shape to match the spec: 45° angle, clean slit, solid dark fill
6. Recolor to `#1a2744` (Ink Midnight)

**Option B: Draw from scratch with Vector tool**
1. Select the Pen tool (P)
2. Click to place anchor points, drag to curve them
3. Rough shape first: click 4 corners of a diamond (nib outline)
4. Add the center slit: use a thin rectangle `#ffffff` overlaid on the nib, from tip to 60% up
5. Use "Flatten" to merge if needed

#### Step 3: Add the Wordmark

1. Select the Text tool (T)
2. Click on your canvas
3. Type: `Inkwell`
4. In the right panel, set:
   - Font: Great Vibes (click the font field and search — Figma auto-loads Google Fonts)
   - Size: `80`
   - Color: `#1a2744`
5. If Great Vibes isn't available, go to [fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes), download the font, install it on your system, then restart Figma

#### Step 4: Assemble the Full Logo

1. Position the pen nib to the left of the wordmark
2. The nib should be sized so its height roughly matches the cap height (height of the "I") of "Inkwell"
3. Visually, the nib tip should point toward the start of the "I" — as if it's writing the word
4. Optional: add a very thin `1px` curved line connecting the nib tip to the base of the "I" to reinforce the "writing" narrative
5. Group all elements: select all → Cmd+G

#### Step 5: Export

For the full logo:
1. Select the frame or group
2. In the right panel → Export → click "+"
3. Add these exports:
   - `SVG` (no size needed for vector)
   - `PNG` at `2x` (for raster needs)
4. Click "Export"

For the icon (nib only):
1. Select just the nib element in your 200×200 frame
2. Resize to ~150×150 (centered in 200×200 gives the 12.5% padding)
3. Export at `SVG`, `1x PNG`, `2x PNG`, `3x PNG`
4. For favicon sizes: right-click → "Export" → enter specific pixel sizes (32, 64, 180, 192, 512)

---

### Path B: Adobe Illustrator

Illustrator is the industry standard for vector logo work.

#### Step 1: Setup

1. File → New → Web → `W: 600px`, `H: 200px`, Color Mode: RGB
2. Open Swatches panel → Add swatch: `#1a2744` (Ink Midnight)
3. Open Typography panel: set installed font to Great Vibes

#### Step 2: Create the Nib

**Using the Pen tool (P):**
1. Click to place anchor points around the nib silhouette
2. Hold Shift+drag on anchor handles to create smooth curves
3. Close the path by clicking the first anchor
4. Fill: `#1a2744`, Stroke: None

**For the center slit:**
1. Draw a thin elongated rectangle (Rectangle tool) from the nib tip upward, ~60% of nib height
2. Width: 2px, Fill: white (`#ffffff`)
3. Align it center on the nib shape

**Rotate the nib:**
1. Select the nib group
2. Object → Transform → Rotate → `45°`

#### Step 3: Wordmark

1. Type tool (T) → Click canvas → Type `Inkwell`
2. Set font: Great Vibes, size: 80pt
3. Fill: `#1a2744`
4. Object → Expand (to convert live text to paths — do this for the final version, not while editing)

#### Step 4: Assemble

Position nib left of wordmark. Align nib tip toward start of "I".

#### Step 5: Export

- File → Export → Export As:
  - `SVG` (Format: SVG, CSS Properties: Presentation Attributes)
  - `PNG` at 300ppi for print, 72ppi for screen rasters

---

### Path C: Photoshop

Photoshop is raster-based — **you can create logos here but SVG export quality is lower than Figma or Illustrator.** Use Photoshop only if it's your only option, and plan to recreate the final logo in a vector tool later.

#### Step 1: Setup

1. File → New:
   - Width: `2400px`, Height: `800px`
   - Resolution: `300 PPI`
   - Color Mode: `RGB Color`
2. Background: Fill with `#fafaf9` (cream)
3. Add a swatch: `#1a2744` as foreground color

#### Step 2: Create Nib Using Shape Tools

1. Select Custom Shape Tool (U) → click "Shape" mode in toolbar
2. Search for a pen nib shape in the shape picker (if installed)
3. **If no pen nib shape available**: Use Pen tool in Shape mode to draw it
   - Click to set anchor points around a diamond shape with curves
   - Fill: `#1a2744`, Stroke: none

**Drawing with Pen tool in Photoshop:**
1. Press P → make sure top toolbar shows "Shape" (not Path)
2. Click to set the top-left corner of the nib
3. Click and drag to create curved sides
4. Click the starting point to close the shape

**The center slit:**
1. Create a new shape layer (thin tall rectangle)
2. Fill: `#ffffff`, position on nib from tip to ~60% height
3. Width: 4–6px at full document size

#### Step 3: Wordmark

1. Select Horizontal Type tool (T)
2. Click on canvas, type `Inkwell`
3. In Character panel:
   - Font: Great Vibes (must be installed — download from fonts.google.com)
   - Size: 120pt
   - Color: `#1a2744`

#### Step 4: Assemble and Export

Position elements. When satisfied:
- File → Export → Export As → PNG for raster files
- For a basic SVG: select all shape layers → File → Export → Export As → SVG (Photoshop's SVG export is not as clean as Illustrator's — it works but may include extra markup)

---

### Path D: AI-Assisted + Trace

Use AI image generation to get a concept image, then trace it in Figma or Illustrator to create the clean vector.

#### Step 1: Generate the Nib Concept

**Using Adobe Firefly** (free at [firefly.adobe.com](https://firefly.adobe.com)):
- Prompt: `fountain pen nib, minimal vector logo style, single color dark navy blue, flat design, isolated on white, no background, professional logo`
- Generate 4 options, pick the cleanest shape

**Using Midjourney** (if you have access):
- Prompt: `fountain pen nib icon logo, minimal, flat vector, single solid dark color, clean geometric form, white background --v 6 --style raw`

**Using DALL-E / ChatGPT**:
- Prompt: `A minimal fountain pen nib logo icon. Flat design, single dark navy color (#1a2744), white background, no texture, vector-style. The nib should be angled 45 degrees, with a center slit visible.`

#### Step 2: Trace in Figma/Illustrator

Once you have an AI-generated nib image:

**In Illustrator:**
1. File → Place → select your image
2. With image selected → Window → Image Trace
3. Settings: Mode: Black and White, Threshold: 150, Paths: 75%, Corners: 75%
4. Click Trace → then Expand
5. Delete the white background shape, keep the nib shape
6. Recolor to `#1a2744`
7. Clean up anchor points with Direct Selection tool (A)

**In Figma:**
1. Import the PNG image
2. In the right panel → click "Trace image" (newer Figma feature) OR
3. Use Figma's Pen tool to manually trace the shape (faster and cleaner)

#### Step 3: Add Wordmark and Assemble

Follow Step 3 from Path A (Figma) or Path B (Illustrator) for the wordmark.

---

### Path E: Canva (Simplest)

Canva is the fastest path but produces the least flexible output. Use for a quick first draft or if you're unfamiliar with other tools.

1. Go to [canva.com](https://canva.com) → Create design → Custom size: `600 × 200px`
2. In Elements → search `"fountain pen nib"` — pick the cleanest minimal result
3. Recolor the element to `#1a2744`
4. Click Text → Add a heading → Type `Inkwell`
5. Font: search "Great Vibes" in the font picker (Canva includes Google Fonts)
6. Recolor text to `#1a2744`
7. Position and align
8. Download as PNG (Canva Pro required for SVG export)

**Note**: Canva SVG export requires Canva Pro. If using free Canva, export as high-res PNG and convert to SVG at [svgtrace.com](https://svgtrace.com) or [vectorizer.io](https://vectorizer.io) — though results vary.

---

## 6. Assembling the Full Logo

Once you have the nib shape and the wordmark separately, assemble them:

### Layout

```
[  nib  ]  Inkwell
    ^            ^
  icon        Great Vibes
  shape          font
```

### Alignment Rules

1. **Vertical center**: The nib and wordmark should be vertically centered with each other — the nib's optical center aligns with the baseline of the cap letters (the "I" height)
2. **Spacing**: Gap between nib right edge and wordmark start = approximately the width of the letter "n"
3. **Nib size**: Height of the nib should be ~1.2× the cap height of "Inkwell" — slightly taller than the letters
4. **The nib tip points toward the "I"**: This is critical for the concept to land — the nib tip angle should point toward where the pen would begin writing the "I"

### The Visual Connection

The "magic" of the logo is that the nib appears to be writing the word. To reinforce this:

- **Option 1 (subtle)**: Just position and angle so the nib tip naturally points to the "I" start — viewers will read the narrative
- **Option 2 (explicit)**: Add a very thin curved line (1px, 30% opacity) flowing from the nib tip to the base of the "I", suggesting an ink flow
- **Option 3 (minimal)**: Leave the nib slightly overlapping the start of the "I" — the cursive "I" in Great Vibes has a natural entry stroke you can use

Try Option 1 first — if it reads clearly as "pen writing the word," you don't need more.

### Icon Assembly

For the standalone icon (favicon, app icon):

1. Take just the nib shape
2. Center it in a perfect square canvas
3. Nib should occupy ~70–75% of the space (12–15% padding on all sides)
4. The 45° angle should be preserved — don't straighten it
5. At small sizes (32px, 16px), the center slit may disappear optically — this is acceptable

---

## 7. Exporting All Variations

Once the full logo is approved, you need to export these color variations:

### How to Create Each Variation

**Full color (default)**:
- Nib: `#1a2744` fill
- Wordmark: `#1a2744` fill
- Background: transparent

**White knockout** (for dark backgrounds):
- Nib: `#ffffff` fill
- Wordmark: `#ffffff` fill
- Background: transparent
- Test on `#1a2744` and `#0c0a09` backgrounds

**Black** (for print, single-color):
- Nib: `#000000` fill
- Wordmark: `#000000` fill
- Background: transparent

**Export each variation** for both the full logo and the icon mark, following the file list in Section 4.

### Favicon.ico

Create the `.ico` file last:
- On Mac: use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) — upload your 512×512 PNG icon, it generates all sizes including `.ico`
- Or use Photoshop's "Save for Web" if you have the ICO format plugin installed

---

## 8. Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, go through this list:

**Concept**
- [ ] The nib visually reads as a fountain pen nib (not a quill, not a pencil)
- [ ] The center slit is visible and clearly readable at the logo's full size
- [ ] The nib angle (45°) suggests mid-stroke writing motion
- [ ] The nib tip points toward the start of the "I" in "Inkwell"

**Typography**
- [ ] "Inkwell" is spelled correctly with capital I
- [ ] The script font reads clearly at logo full size
- [ ] The script reads clearly at 120px wide (small-but-readable)
- [ ] Letter spacing feels natural — no awkward gaps

**Assembly**
- [ ] Nib and wordmark are vertically centered
- [ ] Clear space between nib and wordmark is consistent
- [ ] The full logo reads as one unit, not two separate elements

**Icon (nib mark)**
- [ ] Reads clearly at 32×32px
- [ ] Has adequate padding inside its bounding square
- [ ] The 45° angle is preserved
- [ ] Works as a favicon in a browser tab (squint test: is it identifiable?)

**Color**
- [ ] Full color version uses `#1a2744` (not purple, not a guess)
- [ ] White version is pure `#ffffff`, not off-white
- [ ] All variations are on transparent backgrounds (no white fill)

**Files**
- [ ] SVG files open correctly in a browser
- [ ] PNG files are at correct pixel dimensions
- [ ] Icon PNGs include 180px and 192px for mobile home screen

---

## 9. After the Logo is Done

Once you have your files, here's what needs to happen to make them live:

### In the Brand Assets Repo (`stantondev/inkwellsocial-brand-assets`)

Add all files from Section 4 to this repo. Suggested folder structure:

```
inkwellsocial-brand-assets/
  LICENSE
  brand-style-guide.md
  logo-creation-guide.md
  logo/
    inkwell-logo-full.svg
    inkwell-logo-full@2x.png
    inkwell-logo-white.svg
    inkwell-logo-black.svg
  icon/
    inkwell-icon.svg
    inkwell-icon-512.png
    inkwell-icon-192.png
    inkwell-icon-180.png
    inkwell-icon-64.png
    inkwell-icon-32.png
    favicon.ico
```

### In the Inkwell Codebase

**1. Update the nav logo** (`apps/web/src/components/nav.tsx`):

The current nav uses an inline SVG pen shape. Replace it with either:
- The new `inkwell-icon.svg` as an `<img>` tag with `width="24" height="24"`
- A copy of the SVG path data pasted inline (better for performance — no extra request)

**2. Add the favicon** (`apps/web/public/`):

Copy these files to `apps/web/public/`:
- `favicon.ico`
- `inkwell-icon-180.png` (rename to `apple-touch-icon.png`)
- `inkwell-icon-192.png`
- `inkwell-icon-512.png`

Update `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` metadata to point to the new icons:
```typescript
icons: {
  icon: '/favicon.ico',
  apple: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
},
```

**3. Site-wide color update (separate task)**:

Once the new ink blue palette is confirmed via the logo, update `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` to replace the purple accent with the ink blue palette. This is a significant visual change to the whole site — do it as a separate, intentional update.

### Tell Claude Code

When you bring the new logo files to Claude Code for implementation, say:
> "I have the new logo files ready. Please update the nav logo SVG, add the favicon files to `public/`, and update `layout.tsx` to use the new icons. Also update the color palette in `globals.css` to replace purple with ink blue."

Claude Code will handle the technical implementation once you have the asset files.
